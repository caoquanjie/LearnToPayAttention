## LearnToPayAttention
## a tensorflow implementation of ICLR 2018 paper Learn To Pay Attention

I implemented two versions: VGG-att1-concat-dp and VGG-att2-concat-dp, and I trained the model on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 DATASET.
Finally, we use the pretrained CIFAR-100 model initialise the weights in CUB finetune.
